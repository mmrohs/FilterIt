FilterIt is a small add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox (Version 103 and later)
It might also work on other browsers, but I haven't testet it yet.

FilterIt allows you to add terms to an internal filter list and while loading a webpage it replaces all sentences containing one of those terms with a specific string. Therefore it let's you filter uninteresting topics or people from your browsing experience.
