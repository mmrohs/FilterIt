FilterIt is a tiny add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox (Version 103 and later)
It might also work on other browsers, but I haven't testet it yet.

FilterIt makes it possible to filter uninteresting topics and people from websites.
You simply have to add terms via context menu to an internal filter list and next time the browser loads a webpage it replaces all sentences containing one of those terms with a specific filter string.

Important:
If you know some JavaScript: Feel free helping me with the development of FilterIt!


Ideas for the future
- view of all the elements inside the filter list in a fancy window
- import/export of filter lists
- smarter filter algorithm (the current one is quite primitive)
- new icon
- configurable replacement string (default: '+++ filtered +++') 
- configurable exceptions for websites
