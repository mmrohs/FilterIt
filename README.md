FilterIt is a tiny add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox (Version 105 and later)

FilterIt makes it possible to filter uninteresting topics and people from websites.
The user can simply add terms to an filter list via context menu and next time the browser loads a webpage it replaces all sections containing one of these terms with the text "+++ filtered +++".

Important:
If you know some JavaScript: 
Feel free helping me with the development of FilterIt!


Some ideas for the future
- view of all the elements inside the filter list in a fancy new window
- smarter filter algorithm (the current one is quite primitive)
- new icon
- configurable exceptions for websites
- possibility to input filter terms without the context menu
- browser icon that shows how many elements have been filtered
- import/export of filter lists
- configurable replacement string (default: '+++ filtered +++')
