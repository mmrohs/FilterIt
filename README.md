FilterIt is a tiny add-on for the web browser Mozilla Firefox (Version 105 and newer)

FilterIt makes it possible to filter uninteresting topics and people from websites.
The user can simply add terms to a filter list via context menu and next time the browser loads a webpage it replaces all sections containing one of these terms with the text "+++ filtered +++".

Important:
If you know some JavaScript: 
Feel free helping me with the development of FilterIt!


Some ideas for the future
- view of all the elements inside the filter list in a fancy new window
- smarter filter algorithm (the current one is quite primitive)
- new icon
- configurable exceptions for websites
- possibility to input filter terms without the context menu
- browser icon that shows how many elements have been filtered
- import/export of filter lists
- configurable replacement string (default: '+++ filtered +++')
